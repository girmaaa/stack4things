Project Overview
Title: Enhancing Federated Publish-Subscribe Communication for Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems

Overview
The project aims to enhance real-time communication in Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) through a federated publish-subscribe model using WebSocket technology. It consists of two main components: a super broker and client application. The super broker acts as a centralized hub for managing subscriptions and distributing real-time data among multiple clients.

How to Run
Super Broker:

Navigate to the superbroker directory:

cd ~/stack4things/superbroker
