Open a new terminal or tab.

code
cd superclient
Open superclient.py in a text editor to configure the token and shared secret:
code
nano superclient.py

Update the token and secret variables with the generated token and shared secret respectively.
Run the super client application:
code
python3 superclient.py

Verify that the client connects to the super broker without errors.
Usage
The super broker manages WebSocket connections and facilitates real-time data exchange.
The super client subscribes to topics and receives data published by other clients through the super broker.

Configuration
After installing the dependencies and setting up your project, follow these steps to configure and run the Federated Publish-Subscribe Communication for Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems:

Token Generation

1. Generate Token:

Navigate to the superbroker directory:
Navigate to the superclient directory:

code
cd superbroker

Run the token generator script to generate a token:
code
python3 token_generator.py
Copy the generated token. This token will be used for authenticating connections between the super client and super broker.

Shared Secret Configuration

2. Set Shared Secret:

Open superbroker.py in a text editor:
code
nano superbroker.py

Set the shared_secret variable to match the secret set in superclient.py. This ensures that both the client and server share the same secret for secure communication:
shared_secret = "your_shared_secret_here"

code
shared_secret = "your_shared_secret_here"

Save the superbroker.py file after making changes.

Client Configuration

3. Configure Super Client:

Navigate to the superclient directory:
code
cd ../superclient  # Assuming you're in the superbroker directory
Open superclient.py in a text editor to configure the token and shared secret:
code
nano superclient.py

Update the token and secret variables with the generated token and shared secret respectively:
code
token = "your_generated_token_here"
secret = "your_shared_secret_here"

Save the superclient.py file after making changes.

Usage
After configuring your project as described above, follow the instructions in the Steps to Run section of the README to start the super broker server and run the super client application. Ensure that the configurations in both superbroker.py and superclient.py match the token and shared secret for seamless communication between the client and server.

Usage
Follow these instructions to run the Federated Publish-Subscribe Communication for Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems project:

Steps to Run

1. Start Super Broker Server:

Open a terminal.

Navigate to the superbroker directory where superbroker.py is located:

code
cd path/to/superbroker
Run the super broker server using Python:
code
python3 superbroker.py

2. Run Super Client:

Open a new terminal window/tab.

Navigate to the superclient directory where superclient.py is located:
code
cd path/to/superclient
Run the super client application using Python:
python3 superclient.py

This command starts the WebSocket client that connects to the super broker server using the configured token and shared secret.

Notes:

Ensure that the superbroker.py and superclient.py files are properly configured with the generated token and shared secret as described in the Configuration section.
Keep the super broker server (superbroker.py) running while testing or using the super client application (superclient.py).

Example Scenario
To demonstrate the project in action:

Start the super broker server in one terminal.
Run the super client in another terminal.
Send messages or data from the super client, which should be received and possibly forwarded by the super broker to other connected clients.
Adjust the paths (path/to/superbroker and path/to/superclient) based on where your project directories are located. These instructions provide a clear guide for users to replicate your project setup and run it effectively.




Additional Notes
Token
Using tokens in your project enhances security, scalability, and performance. Tokens enable secure, stateless authentication and authorization, making them ideal for modern distributed systems. By implementing token expiration and secret rotation, you further strengthen the security of your system, ensuring that even if a token or secret is compromised, it can only be used for a limited time. This approach helps you maintain a secure and robust communication system for your Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems project.
Troubleshooting Tips:

If you encounter "address already in use" errors when starting the server (superbroker.py), try changing the port number or ensure no other application is using the same port.
Ensure that all dependencies (websockets, asyncio) are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Limitations:

The current implementation might not handle extremely high loads or concurrent connections efficiently without further optimization.
Limited error handling and logging are implemented; additional robustness can be added for production-level deployments.
Future Enhancements:

Implement SSL/TLS for secure WebSocket connections.
Enhance token and secret management with expiration and rotation policies.
Introduce more advanced message filtering and routing capabilities.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction and monitoring.
Conclusion
The Enhancing Federated Publish-Subscribe Communication for Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems project facilitates real-time communication among distributed systems using WebSocket technology. By running the superbroker.py server and superclient.py clients, users can establish a federated publish-subscribe network. This setup allows efficient data exchange and coordination across multiple devices and systems.
